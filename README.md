Roundcube Plugin: admin_options
===============================

Extendable plugin for Roundcube Webmail to create administrative options.

This plugin will only be shown to users if they are part of the configured admin users and it adds the ability for devs to extend its functionality with other plugins through hooks.

Users with access to admin-options can see a list of other hooked "admin plugins" and used them from settings tab. For example: other plugins can create webui options to control installed/activated plugins, install new skins, change config options, create popup notifications, and so on.
